# Progress Tracker — StepFi-App

Update this file after every completed screen, component, hook, or architectural decision. Progress state must reflect the actual working state — not the intended state.

---

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — Shared Components & Design System**

## Current Goal

Build all shared components from scratch using StepFi's dark theme design system.

---

## Completed

### Project Setup
- `app.json` — name updated to StepFi (scheme `stepfi`, expo-router + expo-secure-store plugins, web bundler `metro` + output `single`, typed routes enabled, splash/adaptive-icon background `#080F1A`)
- `package.json` — name updated to stepfi-app; entry switched to `expo-router/entry`; added `axios`, `zustand`, `expo-secure-store`
- All source files cleaned — zero external project references
- README.md fully written as StepFi-App
- NativeWind configured (tailwind.config.js, metro.config.js)
- Lucide React Native installed as the icon library
- `.env.example` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`

### Foundation Constants & Types
- `constants/colors.ts` — full StepFi dark theme tokens (background/surface/elevated/subtle/borders, text scale, brand blue/green w/ dim variants, cta, error/warning/success w/ dim variants, tier sub-object)
- `constants/config.ts` — `API_BASE_URL` (env-driven), `APP_NAME`, `APP_TAGLINE`
- `constants/theme.ts` — `spacing`, `borderRadius`, `fontSize` scales
- `types/api.types.ts` — `ApiResponse<T>`, `ApiError`, `PaginatedResponse<T>`
- `types/loan.types.ts` — `LoanStatus`, `LoanType`, `Installment`, `Loan`
- `types/wallet.types.ts` — `WalletSession`, `SignXdrResult`, `WalletConnectionStatus`
- `types/user.types.ts` — `LearnerProfile` (added to satisfy `user.store`; mirrors API `learner_profiles` shape)

### Service Layer
- `services/api.ts` — Axios instance, bearer-token request interceptor, single-flight 401 refresh-and-retry interceptor, redirect to `/(auth)/sign-in` on refresh failure
- `services/auth.service.ts` — `getNonce`, `verify`, `refresh`
- `services/reputation.service.ts` — `getScore(wallet)`
- `services/loans.service.ts` — `getMyLoans`, `getLoanById`, `getAvailableCredit`, `createLoan`, `repayInstallment`

### Zustand Stores
- `stores/auth.store.ts` — tokens + wallet address persisted via Expo SecureStore, `hydrate()` invoked from root layout
- `stores/wallet.store.ts` — `isConnected`, `publicKey`, `status` (`WalletConnectionStatus`), `isSigning`
- `stores/user.store.ts` — `profile`, `reputation`, `isLoading`
- `stores/loans.store.ts` — `loans`, `selectedLoan`, `isLoading`

### Navigation (Expo Router)
- `app/_layout.tsx` — root Stack, hydrates auth on mount, redirects unauth → `/(auth)/sign-in`, auth-in-auth-group → `/(tabs)/pay`
- `app/(auth)/_layout.tsx` — Stack
- `app/(auth)/sign-in.tsx`, `app/(auth)/register.tsx` — placeholders
- `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` — bottom Tabs (pay/invest/settings) with Lucide icons (`CreditCard`, `TrendingUp`, `Settings`), brand-green active tint
- `app/(tabs)/pay.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/invest.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/settings.tsx` — placeholders

### Verification
- `npx expo export --platform web` — succeeded (2394 modules bundled, exit 0)

## Open Questions

- Does StepFi-App target Android only, iOS only, or both?
- Which wallets at launch — Lobstr only, or Lobstr + xBull?
- Should amounts display in USD equivalent, local currency, or XLM/USDC only?
- Should sponsor/LP features be in the same app or a separate app?

---

## Architecture Decisions

- Expo Router — file-based routing, simpler auth guards
- Zustand — simpler API, less boilerplate
- Axios — JWT refresh handled globally via interceptors
- WalletConnect v2 — mobile deep link signing for Lobstr and xBull
- Expo SecureStore — encrypted JWT token storage
- Dark theme only — no light mode in v1
- Lucide React Native — single icon library, stroke-based only
- All screens and components built from scratch to StepFi's own design system
- No custodial wallet in v1

---

## Session Notes

- constants/colors.ts is the single source of truth for all colors
- All WalletConnect logic stays in stores/wallet.store.ts
- Every screen must handle loading, error, and empty states
- Use the frontend-design skill for all screen and component work
- Run npx expo start and verify before committing any UI changes
- `App.tsx` is legacy (entry switched to `expo-router/entry`) — safe to delete
